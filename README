Docket is a simple todo list manager that handles simple lists. It's not meant to
manage major projects. Just simply create a list of things you need to do,
what their priority is, and how long they have been on the list.

The best todo list is the one you can use and stick to. Keeping everything simple
allows you to stay focused and not get lost.
